235,Lan-Beauver Pinot Noir 2010,"Loan-Beauver's winemaking philosophy is to produce a wine with both a beautiful and delicate character. The nose is very aromatic, with a hint of blackberry and red cherry. The palate is rich and full-bodied, with a beautiful combination of acidity and fruitiness. The finish is long and elegant."
236,Atth Winery Sauvignon Blanc 2014,"The 2014 vintage started off very dry and rainy, but ended up producing some of the best grapes in recent years. The 2014 Sauvignon Blanc has a lovely yellow-green color with greenish reflections. The nose is floral with hints of ripe tropical fruits such as pineapple, papaya and mango. In the mouth, it is dry, fresh and crisp, with a touch of minerality."
